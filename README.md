# Impact 3.0 - 1.12.2 Forge

## Check out the `fixes` branch for some non source-accurate changes and improvement

I thought this would be fun to make
Some modules are not 100% functional, whether by their original design or because I ported them incorrectly. For example, Animations doesn't quite render properly and InventoryMove doesn't work at all.
The mixins are all an attempt to be as accurate to the original MCP code as possible. It is not meant to be pretty to look at.

### Yes, I got permission for this. I do not like to leak other people's code.
